# What is Sentinel?

* Sentinel implements governance policies as code in the same way that Terraform implements infrastructure as code.
* It uses its own language with sophisticated conditional logic.
* It is embedded in HashiCorp's enterprise products.
* It includes a simulator for testing policies.
