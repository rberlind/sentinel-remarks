# What is Sentinel?

* Sentinel implements governance policies as code in the same way that Terraform implements infrastructure as code.
* It uses its own language with sophisticated conditional logic.
* It is embedded in HashiCorp's enterprise products.
* It includes a simulator for testing policies.

* Sentinel policy checks are run between the plan and apply steps of TFC runs.
* Only authorized users can override policies that have violations.
* Terraform extends Sentinel with several Terraform-specific imports.
* Mocks can be generated for testing with the Sentinel Simulator.
